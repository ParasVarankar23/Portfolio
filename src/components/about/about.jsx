            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                Hello! I'm <b>Paras Pramod Varankar</b>, a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development. I specialize in the <b>MERN stack</b> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have gained hands-on experience through various internships and freelance projects.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                Over the last year, I’ve had the privilege of working on real-world applications during internships at organizations like Nexcore Alliance, Internselite, IBM, Quantum, and more. These experiences helped me grow technically and professionally — from crafting responsive frontends with React and Tailwind CSS, to building dynamic backend systems using Node.js and integrating tools like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                I’ve worked remotely and on-site, across diverse domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Computer Graphics, and Data Science. Some of my proudest projects include a Hospital Management System, a Student Result Management System, and the Siddhi Resort Website.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                I’m currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Information Technology at Pillai College, Panvel, and continue to stay curious, adaptive, and eager to learn emerging technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it's designing a sleek user interface, optimizing for SEO, or developing scalable APIs — I enjoy every step of creating meaningful and user-friendly web solutions.
